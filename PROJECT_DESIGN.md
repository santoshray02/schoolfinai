5. Track payment history

### 6. Expense Tracking

#### Key Features
- Expense category management
- Expense recording
- Receipt upload and storage
- Approval workflow
- Budget tracking

#### Expense Recording Process
1. Create expense categories
2. Record expenses with details
3. Upload receipts
4. Get approval (if required)
5. Track against budget

### 7. Reports Dashboard

#### Key Features
- Financial summaries
- Income vs. expense reports
- Fee collection status
- Salary disbursement reports
- Custom report generation
- Data export (PDF, Excel)

#### Key Reports
- Monthly/Yearly financial summary
- Outstanding fee reports
- Expense category breakdown
- Staff salary reports
- Student fee payment history

## Technical Implementation Details

### Database Schema
The database schema is designed to be normalized and efficient. Key relationships include:
- One-to-many relationship between students and fee payments
- One-to-many relationship between staff and salaries
- One-to-many relationship between fee categories and fee payments
- One-to-many relationship between expense categories and expenses

### API Design
The API follows RESTful principles with the following structure:
- `/api/auth/*` - Authentication endpoints
- `/api/students/*` - Student management endpoints
- `/api/fees/*` - Fee management endpoints
- `/api/staff/*` - Staff management endpoints
- `/api/expenses/*` - Expense tracking endpoints
- `/api/reports/*` - Reporting endpoints
- `/api/sms/*` - SMS notification endpoints

### Security Considerations
- Input validation using Zod
- Authentication with NextAuth.js
- Role-based access control
- CSRF protection
- Rate limiting for API endpoints
- Secure password storage with bcrypt
- HTTP-only cookies for authentication
- Content Security Policy

### Performance Optimization
- Server-side rendering for initial page load
- Client-side data fetching for dynamic updates
- Database indexing for common queries
- Pagination for large data sets
- Caching strategies for frequently accessed data
- Optimized database queries

## Deployment Strategy

### Development Environment
- Local development with Docker for database
- Environment variables for configuration
- Hot reloading for rapid development

### Testing Strategy
- Unit tests for utility functions
- Integration tests for API endpoints
- End-to-end tests for critical flows
- Automated testing in CI pipeline

### Production Deployment
- Vercel for hosting (recommended)
- PostgreSQL database (managed service like Supabase or Railway)
- Environment variables for configuration
- Continuous integration and deployment

### Scaling Considerations
- Horizontal scaling for web servers
- Database connection pooling
- Caching layer for frequently accessed data
- CDN for static assets
- Optimized database queries and indexing
